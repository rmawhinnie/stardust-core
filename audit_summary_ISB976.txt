Case File: ISB-976-DS1
Subject: Post-Incident Audit of Project Stardust
Date: 0 BBY + 3 days
Classification: Theta-Black (Eyes Only)

Lead Auditor: Lt. Col. Thren Valik
Review Location: Remains of DS-1 Orbital Platform

------------------------------------------------------------
FINDINGS
------------------------------------------------------------

[1] Undocumented failsafe function `stardust_protocol()` embedded within main reactor control. Not found in formal specs. Triggered under predictable thermal stress conditions (>97.5% output).

[2] Failsafe routes plasma directly into unshielded thermal exhaust port. No access control. No logging suppression. Just... runs.

[3] Function originally flagged by static scanner but allowed to pass due to inline comment: "temporary patch – definitely not a trap."

[4] Pull request (#1138) was approved by Director Krennic with the note: "Let’s not get bogged down in engineering minutiae."

[5] Git log includes developer comments suggesting intentional sabotage, including:
    - "// If you're reading this, it's too late."
    - "// This is how we bring it down from the inside."

[6] Bug report was submitted to Civic Bug Bounty Program two weeks before incident. Marked as duplicate. No action taken.

[7] No rollback procedures implemented. No QA validation of production hotfixes. Build system prioritized uptime optics over safety.

[8] Internal compliance audits were falsified using looped data from "staging-core-7", a dev instance set to return constant pass.

------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

- Immediate revocation of Civic Openness Mandates.
- Redaction of Project Stardust documentation from all public Holonet archives.
- Posthumous dishonorable mention for Galen Erso.
- Retroactive blame assignment to QA interns (pending availability).
- Consider blaming the Force.

PERSONAL NOTES (NOT FOR INCLUSION IN FINAL REPORT)
------------------------------------------------------------

I don’t even think this was sabotage. I think he just... knew they wouldn’t read the diff.

This wasn’t a flaw. This was a confession — written in code, in plain sight, and ignored.

Request reassignment. Preferably to somewhere less explosive.
