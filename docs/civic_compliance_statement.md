## 🛠️ Continuous Compliance (CivOps 4.2)

Project Stardust undergoes nightly CIC (Continuous Imperial Compliance) scans using the **BICE Jenkins Compliance Pipeline™**, including:

- Linting for forbidden subroutines (`forceOverride`, `targetAll()`)
- Core-load simulation under planetary conditions
- Vulnerability tagging with `#civic-risk`, `#rebel-magnet`, or `#not-our-fault`

All issues not flagged as **Class-1 Rebellion Catalysts** are deferred to Q4 Roadmap.

## ❗Disclaimers

- This project is not legally classified as a weapon.
- All destructive incidents are attributable to user error, Force-related sabotage, or misinterpretation of exhaust diagrams.
- Reactor instability is a known edge case and will be addressed in v1.8.
