## ☣️ Critical Issues

---

### 🔥 `stardust_protocol()` triggers irreversible meltdown under stress
**Status:** Won’t Fix
**Notes:**
- Occurs at >97.5% core load.
- Failsafe logic routes plasma into main exhaust port.
- Reported multiple times. Assigned to “Low Priority - CivEng.”
- Galen labeled it "intentional redundancy."

---

### 🌪️ Thermal exhaust port exposed
**Status:** "Acceptable Risk"
**Notes:**
- Shielding removed for budgetary reasons.
- Cooling efficiency rated “high enough.”
- Krennic approved spec after five drinks and a Senate subcommittee hearing.
- Incidentally aligned with reactor core, but that's probably fine.

### 🎯 Targeting algorithm shows drift at planetary distances
**Status:** Under Observation
**Notes:**
- Test shots hit wrong hemisphere in simulation.
- Drift increases with proximity to Force-sensitive individuals (unexplained).
- Suggested fix involves tuning bias vector… which breaks other systems.
- Flagged as “non-blocking” by QA.

## ⚙️ Medium Issues

### 💾 Logging system includes incriminating details
**Status:** Redacted
**Notes:**
- Log output contains phrases like “superlaser online” and “stardust_protocol initialized.”

### 🧵 Comment field contains seditious developer notes
**Status:** Flagged for Morale Re-Education
**Notes:**

- One says:  "// If you're reading this, it's too late."
- HR has opened a wellness investigation.

### 📦 CICD pipeline promotes broken builds
**Status:** By Design
**Notes:**
- Tests pass locally but fail in prod (especially during planetary alignment).
- Compliance pipeline ignores `stardust_protocol` due to legacy whitelist.
- Linting rules prioritize speed over accuracy.
- “Build Green” culture discouraged failure reporting.
