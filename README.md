# ⭐ Project Stardust: Kyber-Powered Civic Energy Core

> *Lighting the galaxy. Sustainably. Strategically. Subtly.*

Welcome to **Project Stardust**, an open-source, modular kyber-reactor framework designed to power orbital platforms, megastructures, and large-scale planetary infrastructure.

Initially developed under the Empire's **Open Infrastructure Directive (OID-1784)**, Stardust represents a bold leap toward energy equity, universal compliance, and scalable civic harmony.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚛️ **Kyber Crystal Reactor Matrix**
  - Real-time alignment for maximum output stability
  - Auto-scaling to planetary grid loads or military-grade superweapons

- 🌪️ **Thermal Exhaust Optimization**
  - Efficient core venting via reinforced micro-shafts
  - Supports dynamic cooling loops (note: unshielded by design)

- 🛡️ **Failsafe Activation Protocol**
  - Emergency override: `stardust_protocol()` (see `main/reactor_control.c`)
  - Triggered at high-load thresholds > 97.5%
  - Absolutely not exploitable. Definitely not a security risk.

- 🎯 **Targeting API (BETA)**
  - JSON-based coordinates
  - Multi-language support (Basic, Huttese, Python)
  - Please do not test in production
